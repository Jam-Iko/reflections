What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When you initialize a repository, it creates a hidden directory .git 
    that will store themetadata with history of changes made to the files
    in the repository. 
    You need to initialize the repository in order to start storing such metadata.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?  

	Staging area is an intermediary area between working directory and repository. You 
	can add files to the staging area, work on them and then create a commit that 
	a logical change. Its value is in the fact that you are not urged to commit all of 
	the files in your working directory, but can decide which files will make the most 
	logical sense for a commit.
