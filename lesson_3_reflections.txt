When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
    When you are collaborating with other people or work with the project from different 
    work stations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You may be contributing to a remote with your collaborators, if you are working on 
	separate issues, you may not want to automatically pull the updates, as they may 
	affect the progress in your local Git repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

	Branches - are created within a single local repository, but also can be pushed 
	or pulled to/from a remote repository. 
	Clone - copying a repository along with its log of changes within local git, 
	from the remote, or from someone else's Github. The original cloned rep is not 
	referenced.
	Fork - cloning someone's repository within GitHub, the original repository is 
	referenced, but unaltered by the changes committed.
